# Rool

Hi, I’m Rool, a senior freelance iOS developer, working on internet, web, app, mobile and tablet projects since 1997. With over 25 years of experience in software development, I consider myself to be a well rounded professional.

## Early Start

I’ve been developing for the internet since the last century. You name it, I’ve build it. Remember those CDs you got with every magazine to get your dial-up connection to the internet? You guessed it, I build that in my awesome [Perl](https://www.perl.org/) hacker days. I’ve build a complete advertisement banner program, long before the Google Ad days. 

Things change, so I jumped on the web development train in 2002. Starting with websites in [PHP](http://www.php.net/), I progressed to mass mailing systems, content management systems and online collaboration tools.

## Mobile First

The rise of the mobile phone lead to the *“mobile first”* trend, so once again I shifted my focus to mobile development. Starting with touch frameworks, I soon found my way into the native stuff, developing both for iOS in Objective-C and for [Android](https://www.android.com/). 

Around 2011 I saw a ever growing demand for those mobile skills, so I became a part-time freelancer. After building some cool projects both for iOS and Android, I found myself doing more and more iOS and less and less Android. 

As soon as [Apple](https://www.apple.com/nl/swift/) announced [Swift](https://developer.apple.com/swift/), I jumped on the Swift train. Starting late 2014, I became a full time freelance iOS developer.

## Freelance iOS developer

So here I am today, a senior freelance iOS developer, looking for cool projects on the crossroads of mobile apps, data, APIs, ready to deliver an amazing experience. If you have such a project, you came to the right place! Just send me an [email](mailto:rool@rool.nl) or reach out to me on any social platform. I would love to hear from you!
